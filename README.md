# C++ Command-Line Calculator

Project Overview:

	A simple, command-line calculator that parses and evaluates mathematical expressions. Supportd addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), and division(/), as well as parentheses, following standard operator precedence/

Motivations:

 I built this project to:

  Strengthen my C++ string parsing, control flow, and debugging skills.

  Practice algorithmic thinking for expression evaluation and operator precedence handling.

  Develop a practical tool entirely from scratch without relying on pre-existing libraries for calculation logic.

Key Features:

  -Detailed Debugging Outputs

  -Parentheses handling & operator precedence

  -(Planned) Variable assignment + Handling

  -(Planned) Floating Point Arithmetic Support
